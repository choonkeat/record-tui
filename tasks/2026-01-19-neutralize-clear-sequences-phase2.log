055907 - Step 1: Create internal/session/clear.go with NeutralizeClearSequences function
055907 - Expected: All tests from Phase 1 should pass (green)
060047 - Observed: All 11 NeutralizeClearSequences tests PASS
060047 - Got: internal/session tests pass (0.008s)
060047 - Note: 4 pre-existing failures in internal/record (script command syntax Linux vs macOS) - not related to our changes
