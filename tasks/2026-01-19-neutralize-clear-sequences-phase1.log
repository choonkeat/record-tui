055731 - Starting Phase 1: Research & Test Setup
055731 - Step 1: Create test file internal/session/clear_test.go with failing tests
055731 - Expected: Tests should fail to compile or fail because NeutralizeClearSequences function doesn't exist yet
055921 - Observed: Tests fail to compile as expected
055921 - Got: "undefined: NeutralizeClearSequences" for all 10+ test functions
055921 - This confirms our TDD setup is correct - tests are red
055921 - Created internal/session/clear_test.go with 11 test cases covering:
         - SimpleClear, ClearWithHome, HomeThenClear, ClearScrollback
         - MultipleClears, NoClear, ClearAtStart, ClearAtEnd
         - OnlyClears, PreservesOtherANSI
055921 - Phase 1 complete
