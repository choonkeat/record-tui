074408: Starting Phase 3 - Fix streaming discrepancies
Will be done:
1. Analyze the diff output from make test
2. Identify root cause of trailing whitespace mismatch
3. Fix the streaming implementation
4. Re-run make test until all pass

Expected: make test passes with 0 mismatches

074408: Analyzing the mismatch
Issue: After "terminal cleared" separator, Go has more trailing spaces than JS
Go: "                                " (32 spaces)
JS: "                \r\n.[38;5;174m .." (16 spaces then CRLF and content)

This indicates the streaming cleaner is not preserving the full line content.
Looking at the code, the issue is likely in how trailing buffer content is processed
when it contains whitespace-only content that should NOT trigger pendingSeparator.
