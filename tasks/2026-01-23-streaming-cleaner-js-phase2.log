074255: Starting Phase 2 - Update Node.js Test Harness
Will be done:
1. Add createStreamingCleaner import
2. Add seeded PRNG for random chunk sizes
3. Add processWithStreaming() function
4. Replace batch call with streaming
5. Add clean-compare-output Makefile target
6. Update test target ordering

Expected: generate_output.js will use streaming with random chunks, make test will run clean first

074342: Phase 2 implementation complete
Observed:
- Modified generate_output.js to use streaming with random chunks (64B-16KB)
- Added seeded PRNG with SEED env var for reproducibility
- Added clean-compare-output target to Makefile
- Updated test target to: clean-compare-output test-go test-js compare-output

074342: Ran make test (expected to fail per TDD)
Result: FAIL as expected
- 5 matches, 2 mismatches, 1 live recording skipped
- Mismatches in session-0d5cf2bf and session-776693f7
- Issue: trailing whitespace handling after clear sequences
- Go has more spaces, JS ends line earlier - likely trailing buffer boundary issue

Conclusion: Phase 2 complete (Red phase) - proceeding to Phase 3 to fix discrepancies
