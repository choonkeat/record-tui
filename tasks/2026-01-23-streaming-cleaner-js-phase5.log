074857: Starting Phase 5 - Remove orphaned code
Will be done:
1. Identify functions only used by batch processing
2. Verify which functions streaming uses
3. Remove orphaned functions
4. Update exports
5. Update self-tests
6. Run make test to verify

Expected: Code cleanup without breaking functionality

075000: Removed orphaned code
Removed:
- neutralizeClearSequences() - was only called by cleanSessionContent()
- cleanSessionContent() - batch entry point, no longer needed

Kept:
- CLEAR_SEPARATOR - used by streaming
- clearPattern - used by streaming
- stripHeader() - used by streaming
- stripFooter() - used by streaming
- createStreamingCleaner() - the new primary API

Updated exports to only export kept functions.

075010: Updated self-tests
- Removed tests for neutralizeClearSequences() and cleanSessionContent()
- Updated streaming tests to verify against known expected values
- Added verifyChunkIndependence() helper to test multiple chunk sizes
- 8 streaming tests verify consistent behavior regardless of chunking

075041: All tests pass
- node cleaner.js: 10 tests PASS (2 helper + 8 streaming)
- make test: 7 matches, 0 mismatches

Conclusion: Phase 5 complete - orphaned code removed, cleaner.js is now streaming-only
