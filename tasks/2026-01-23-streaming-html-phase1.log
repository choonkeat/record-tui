       GOT: Complete implementation with:
            - xterm.js loaded from CDN
            - stripHeader() function matching Go logic
            - stripFooter() function matching Go logic  
            - neutralizeClearSequences() function with regex pattern
            - streamSession() function with buffering for header/footer/escape sequences
            - Loading indicator that hides on first write
            - resizeToFitContent() for dimension handling after streaming
