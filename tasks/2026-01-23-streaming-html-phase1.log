085743 STARTING Phase 1 Step 1: Create test harness (public/streaming-test.html)
       WILL DO: Create minimal HTML file that loads xterm.js from CDN and contains streaming implementation
       EXPECT: File created at public/streaming-test.html with xterm.js loading, streaming functions, loading indicator

085837 COMPLETED Phase 1 Steps 1-7: Created test harness with all streaming functions
       OBSERVED: File created at public/streaming-test.html
       GOT: Complete implementation with:
            - xterm.js loaded from CDN
            - stripHeader() function matching Go logic
            - stripFooter() function matching Go logic  
            - neutralizeClearSequences() function with regex pattern
            - streamSession() function with buffering for header/footer/escape sequences
            - Loading indicator that hides on first write
            - resizeToFitContent() for dimension handling after streaming
       STATUS: Ready for browser verification

085911 STARTING Phase 1 Verification: Manual browser test
       WILL DO: Start Python HTTP server on port 3000, serve public/streaming-test.html and sample.log
       EXPECT: 
         - Browser shows "Loading..." initially
         - Content renders progressively (not all at once)
         - Header lines ("Script started on...") don't appear in output
         - Footer lines ("Script done on...") don't appear in output  
         - Clear sequences show separator (not actual clear)
         - No JavaScript console errors
